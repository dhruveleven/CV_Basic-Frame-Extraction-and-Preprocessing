# CV_Basic-Frame-Extraction-and-Preprocessing
This project is a simple yet foundational implementation of basic computer vision preprocessing techniques using OpenCV. It demonstrates how to extract frames from a video and apply common image processing steps such as grayscale conversion, blurring, and edge detection.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a pipeline that:

Extracts frames from a video file

Applies basic preprocessing steps to each frame:

Convert to Grayscale

Apply Gaussian Blur

Perform Edge Detection (Canny)

This serves as a stepping stone for larger computer vision tasks like object detection, video summarization, and motion tracking.

ðŸ§° Techniques Used
Frame Extraction: Capture video frames at a regular interval.

Grayscale Conversion: Simplify images by reducing to a single channel.

Blurring: Apply Gaussian Blur to reduce noise and smoothen the image.

Edge Detection: Use the Canny algorithm to highlight edges in the frame.
